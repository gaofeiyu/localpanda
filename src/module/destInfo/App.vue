			<h3>Beijing: Where Ancient and Modern Co-Exist</h3>
			<p>China is one of the world’s oldest civilizations and in fact has the longest continuous history of any country. So it should be no surprise that its capital city, Beijing, showcases many sites that will fascinate any history buff. But Beijing offers more than just cool historical sites. Here at Local Panda, the China travel experts on our team have looked into the best things to do in Beijing, when is the best time of year to visit Beijing, and how you can get around the city. So here’s your guide to help you plan your authentic Beijing experience.</p>
			<h3>Top 10 Things to Do in Beijing</h3>
			<p>1. Walk in the footsteps of the emperors in Forbidden City</br>
				Home to 24 emperors in the Ming and Qing dynasties (1420–1911),
				the Forbidden City will fill you with awe and wonder as you traverse its halls. This was the political and ceremonial heart of China, so much so that the city of Beijing was planned around its North/South orientation. Its architecture became the model for Chinese classical architecture and continues to inspire artistic works to this day. It’s no wonder why many consider this site to be the top place in Beijing to visit.</p>
			<p>2. Visit the historical Tian’anmen Square</br>
				After you visit the Forbidden City, head over toTian’anmen Square. The world’s largest public square,
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11032" target="_blank"> Tian’anmen Square</a> has been witness to many historical events in China. This visually impressive square is surrounded by monumental buildings like the National People’s Congress. If you’re an early riser, you can catch the daily flag-raising at sunrise. At the center of the square, you’ll find the
				Mausoleum of Mao Zedong where Mao’s embalmed body rests in a crystal coffin for public viewing.
			</p>
			<p>3. Stroll through the gardens at the Summer Palace</br>
				Make sure you visit to the
				 Summer Palace, another one of the best sites to visit in Beijing. The Summer Palace’s ensemble of gardens, lakes, and palaces is a feast for the eyes. Take your time
				<a href="https://www.localapanda.com/activity/details/11025" target="_blank">strolling through the grounds</a>, and maybe even take a ride on a dragon boat (April-October only). Be sure to check out the
				Marble Boat, a pavilion with a stone base and wooden superstructure that’s representative of traditional Chinese style. Ironically, the money used to restore the Summer Palace in 1893 was appropriated from a fund meant to build up the imperial navy. But hey, even though the navy didn’t get working boats, the emperor still got to enjoy his pavilion, right?
			</p>
			<p>4. Experience the Temple of Heaven like the locals</br>
				Beijing has many parks frequented by locals, but none nearly as well-known as the park surrounding the
				Temple of Heaven. Stroll through the park in the morning and you’ll see elderly men and women doing tai chi, practicing ground calligraphy, or playing cards, Mahjong, and Chinese chess. The Temple itself was built for annual ceremonies of prayer to
				Heaven for good harvest, and each aspect of its architecture holds symbolic value. As Earth is represented by a square and Heaven by a circle, the temple has many features that use those shapes to emphasize the connection between Heaven and Earth. One interesting feature of the Temple of Heaven is its
				Circular Mound Altar whose smooth walls and floor lend to voice amplification. The authentic Beijing experience coupled with the amazing Chinese architecture are what makes the Temple of Heaven
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11025" target="_blank"> one of the best places in Beijing</a> to visit.</p>
			<p>
				5. Eat ALL the food</br>
				You may be wondering about what’s the best food in Beijing to eat. Frankly, you can’t go wrong no matter what you try. Why not
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11058" target="_blank">try some of the famous gourmet Peking roast duck </a> after catching a Shaolin Kung Fu show? Perhaps you’re interested in trying a little of everything on a
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11058" target="_blank"> hutong food and beer tour</a>. Some of the best restaurants in Beijing aren’t overly glamorous but will give you a savory taste of real Chinese food. For all the foodies out there, we recommend taking a
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11089" target="_blank">3-hour private night tour</a> that will give you a true Beijing culinary experience. And if you really want to experience Beijing cuisine,
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11024" target="_blank"> try taking a Chinese cooking class and market tour</a> for an authentic culinary experience. Whatever you’re craving, Beijing is sure to please with some of the most mouth-watering dishes around.
			</p>
			<p>
				6. Hike the Great Wall</br>
				How could we write about the best things to do in Beijing without mentioning a visit to the Great Wall? Yes, it looks even better than the pictures, and yes, you can thank us afterward for your reaction-worthy snaps to post after your trip.</p>
			<p>There are many sections of the Great Wall, each with their own appeal. Embark on a private tour to the
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11021" target="_blank">Mutianyu section</a> and, after enjoying the gorgeous scenery, ride a toboggan back down to the bottom. If you take a sunset tour of
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11028" target="_blank">the Great Wall at Gubeiko and Jinshanling</a>, you’ll definitely see one of the most remarkable sunsets in your life.</p>
			<p>If you’re craving more of a physical challenge,
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11026" target="_blank">take a hike from Simatai West to Jinshanling</a>. For the most challenging hike, hikers and adventurers can take a full day to
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11028">hike from Jiankou to Mutianyu</a>. No matter what part of the wall you visit, a
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11022" target="_blank"> Beijing Great Wall tour</a> is an essential part of any visit to the city.</p>
			<p>7. Explore Beijing’s iconic hutongs</br>
				At this point we’ve covered the best places in Beijing of former royalty. But what about what’s representative of the grassroots Beijingers? Look no further than the hutongs, mazes of alleyways formed by residences that date back centuries. The remnants of an era past, these dying old neighborhoods are now protected to conserve this unique part of Beijing history. You can take a rickshaw or bike through Beijing’s hutongs. Tucked away in hidden corners of the hutongs are restaurants and tea houses that you can’t find on your own, so we recommend taking a
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11090" target="_blank">private hutong food walking tour</a> to get a taste of the old Beijing. And if you want to go into the private courtyard houses that make up these old neighborhoods, you’ll need a local guide to lead the way.
			</p>
			<p>8. Head to the 798 Art District to peruse contemporary art</br>
				For all the art aficionados out there, here’s one place that you won’t want to miss. The >
				798 Art District is one of the coolest modern locales in Beijing to visit.
				<a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11018" target="_blank">Check out the pieces</a> that some of Asia’s best contemporary artists have created in this re-purposed old military factory.</p>
			<p>9. Admire the architecture of the Olympic Park buildings up close and personal</br>
				China was quite proud to host the Olympics back in 2008, and what is left of the Olympic Village has been conserved as the architecturally alluring Olympic Park. What makes this one of the best places in Beijing to visit is undoubtedly the Bird’s Nest building which reflects aspects of ancient Chinese ceramics in its construction.
			</p>
			<p>10. Take your Friends to Central Perk</br>
				Okay, we admit it: the show
				Friends is pretty American. But there is a surprising sub-culture in China that is obsessed with Ross, Rachel, and the rest of the gang. So much so that one diehard fan created a working replica of the show’s main hang, the Central Perk cafe. If you want a unique place to visit in Beijing, look no further than this cafe. Whether you’re a child of the 90s or want to meet Chinese college students learning English through old Friends re-runs, this is an obscure joint off the beaten path that you’re sure to enjoy.
			</p>
			<h3>What about the weather?</h3>
			<p>Beijing has a temperate, monsoon climate. The summers are hot and humid, while the winters are cold and dry. The coldest month, January, has an average temperature of -4°C (25°F) and the hottest month, July, has an average temperature of 26°C (79°F).</p>
			<p>There are definitely certain times of the year when you’d rather visit Beijing than others. In the summer during peak tourist season, you can expect sizzling sun and drenching downpours. The best time to visit Beijing is in the autumn between September and November, the season with comfortable temperatures for hiking and exploring in the outdoors. Shutterbugs will also marvel at the gorgeous fall foliage that Beijing has to offer, making already spectacular views of sites like the Great Wall or the Summer Palace even more incredible.</p>
			<p>But that’s not to say the other seasons don’t have their own offerings as well. The spring in Beijing has blooming flowers and many shows or performances to enjoy. Beijing winters are chilly, but you can warm yourself up with some delicious hot-pot and dumplings. You can also experience Chinese New Year festivities or go skiing.</p>
			<p>We’re sure you’ve heard the horror stories of the air quality in Beijing. But never fear— the pollution is generally not harmful to healthy people, but we do advise sensitive groups to wear 3M n95 masks. However, the air quality is worse in the winter on average due to central heating and in the summer due to the humidity, so whether you’re looking for clearer shots or trying to avoid the smog, consider planning your trip for a different time of year.</p>
			<h3>Getting around the city</h3>
			<p>So what’s the transportation in Beijing like? With a population of 21.5 million people, Beijing can tend to be traffic heavy. But the booming modern metropolis does have many public transportation offerings to choose from like subways and buses to avoid traffic. If you’re nervous about getting around without knowing Mandarin, you might consider hiring a local driver who knows the ins and outs of the city in order to navigate particularly congested areas. Luckily for our clients, almost all of our tour packages include a private vehicle and driver, so you can rest easy as you travel around Beijing.</p>
			<h3>Plan your trip to Beijing</h3>
			<p>There’s so much that Beijing has to offer that we couldn’t even fit it all on one list. <a href="https://www.localpanda.com/activity/details/11029" target="_blank">Take a tour of the Ming Tombs</a> where Emperor Yongle (the first emperor in Beijing) and his Empress Xu were buried. Check out Jingshan Park and Beihai Park to experience more of the community feel that Beijing holds. The Beijing Zoo hosts China’s national treasure: adorable pandas. Perhaps you’d like to look for some souvenirs from the Hongqiao Pearl Market— just make sure you bring your local guide with you to teach you how to haggle!</p>
